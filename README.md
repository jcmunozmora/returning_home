## Original DataSet - CWIQ Burundi (2006)

We use the Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaire –CWIQ– for Burundi (2006). From the original data set (7199 households), we left out households with missing observations in the variables of interest (displacement and expenditure). Our final sample is 6700 households.

## Sampling Correction

The CWIQ follows a two-stage sampling design: first, the main sampling units were defined as sous-colline and some urban zones. The universe of sous-collines was 9614 sous-colline and 301 urban zones, which were located at 17 provinces and 3 urban zones (i.e. strata).  Second, from an universe of 1306471 rural households and 77190 urban households, households were randomly selected within each selected sampling unit (Republique du Burundi, 2006).
